  "summary": "The diff implements all four requirements (REQ-28 through REQ-31). The backend adds resetAdmin() with no access control and fixes initializeAdmin() with proper null/option switching. The frontend AdminDashboard adds auto-initialize logic, cache invalidation, and a monochrome 'Reset Admin & Claim Access' button with loading/error states. The useQueries hook adds both useInitializeAdmin and useResetAdmin mutations. Implementation appears complete and consistent with all acceptance criteria.",
