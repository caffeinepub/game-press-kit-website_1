  "summary": "All three requirements (REQ-19, REQ-20, REQ-21) appear to be implemented in the diff. REQ-19 is addressed by updating VIDEO_ID to 'C-Q0-2kiFhs' with playsinline/fs=0 params in PressKitPage.tsx. REQ-20 is addressed by adding a click handler on the image element to close fullscreen and removing navigation arrows. REQ-21 is addressed via the migration.mo file that resets accessControlState while preserving all other CMS variables.",

      "description": "A migration module (backend/migration.mo) was added that resets accessControlState via a full Actor migration pattern, introducing new migration infrastructure not mentioned in the build request.",
      "reason": "REQ-21 requested clearing the stored adminPrincipal stable variable directly. The diff instead introduces a full migration.mo module with an Actor type definition and a run() function. While this accomplishes the goal, it introduces an entirely new migration infrastructure pattern not mentioned in the build request.",
