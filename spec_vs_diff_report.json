  "summary": "Both REQ-37 and REQ-38 appear to be implemented in the diff. Header.tsx is rewritten with the Internet Identity login button, and PressKitPage.tsx is noted in the file summary as having 1px borders on screenshot images. However, the PressKitPage.tsx diff is truncated so the actual img element changes cannot be fully verified. The fullscreen overlay border is described in the summary as '1px solid white' only, without the light/dark conditional required by the spec.",

      "reason": "The file summary states 'the fullscreen overlay image has a 1px solid white border' without mentioning a light/dark conditional. The spec requires the border to be black in light mode and white in dark mode for the overlay as well. The truncated diff prevents full verification.",
