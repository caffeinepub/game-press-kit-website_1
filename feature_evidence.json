Audit the AuthClient configuration for known cross-browser issues: ensure the identity provider URL is correctly set for production (using the IC mainnet II canister URL), that popup/redirect handling is compatible with browsers that block third-party popups, and that the delegationIdentity and storage options are set in a browser-agnostic way. If the hook itself cannot be modified (immutable path), create a wrapper or patch the integration layer in useActor.ts or App.tsx to resolve the compatibility gap.",
