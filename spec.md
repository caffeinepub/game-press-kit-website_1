# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Clean up the Landing page by removing the newsletter subscribe component and the "Welcome to our game" heading.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the newsletter email input and Subscribe button from the Landing page
- Remove the "Welcome to our game" heading/text from the Landing page
- Keep the game logo, CMS-driven description paragraph, and "View Press Kit" CTA button intact

**User-visible outcome:** The Landing page displays only the game logo, the game description, and the "View Press Kit" button — without the newsletter signup form or welcome heading.
